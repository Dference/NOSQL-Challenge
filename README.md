## What the Health?
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. For this assignment, the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, requested to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before performing any queries or analysis for them, so that was the first step. For this, I added a new restaurant to the database, as well as limited results to specific locations in the UK, then performed the analysis on the database. Eat Safe, Love had specific questions they wanted answered, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.

## No Reservations
The analysis for the database was constucted off of the following questions:

Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
